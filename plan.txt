sort into 2d array for hex and colour in one row? y
find similar string method? y
maybe import package? n

user types in 6 characters
check if 6 char are a valid hexadecimal
computer tells them what number was closest?

find out if you can limit length of an entered string n


// CheckAgainstColours();
possibly make a 2d array with 1 coloum being the 
return of the Compare() method
and the other being the iteration of i

check the lowest value in the array 
possibly using a for loop to cycle through the values?

if more than one hexadeciamal is different than randomly 
choose colour?
